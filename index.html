                <h3>Do we care for our planet?</h3>
                <p>Keeping the planet clean is an important goal we should all strive for. Several countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas are invigorating strict sanitation laws and systems to keep the streets and water clean. However, we are still collectively
                    dumping trash that we collect into the Earth. We are slowly destroying our planet by intoxicating it for our children and their children. Here are a few facts.</p>
                <h3>What is the problem here?</h3>
                <p> Due to the lack of funding for better ways to recycle and disintegrate trash, we are sticking to our primitive way of dumping sewage and unprocessed trash into the marine habitat. We have come so far as humans with many technological advancements
                    yet we have barely fought to bring true justice to the habitats and animals we harm with our careless and heartless dumping of trash. Ecosystems are being destroyed.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>How can we fix it?</h3>
                <p>Several countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas are invigorating strict sanitation laws and systems to keep the streets and water clean. However, we cannot start with the bigger things. Change always begins in its smallest stage. Look
                    at your town, your city, and make change there first. Advocate and protest for sanitation regulations. Contact your governor, president, prime minister and plead for better recycling and waste dumping systems with a petition and the
                    voices of thousands of supporters. </p>
                <h3>Make changes for yourself...</h3>
                <p>Don't forget about your consumption of products and your own responsibiity of sanitation. Make sure you have recycling bins and waste bins at hand in order to efficiently distinguish between the 2 types of waste. Recycle all the time.
                    Reuse glass bottles, plastic bags and other non-degradable products instead of throwing them out because over 93% of non-degradable products are thrown into the ocean where they will stay for thousands of years.</p>
